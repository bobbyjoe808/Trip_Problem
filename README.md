### Trip_Problem ###

In this problem you have a list of iteams each with a [love. weight] value.
Your goal is to get the heighest 'love' value without going passed the 'max weight value'
of the iteams. 

By (g)enerating new tags you are writing new random values to [love, weight] stored in the 'iteam_tags.txt' file.
(U)se current tags keeps the tags in the file and uses them for the problem.

You can eaither use 'evolution' which uses a genetic algorithum to find best possability out of the list or
'brute' by forcibly finding the correct answer by finding all possabilities and keeping the best one.

When you find the amount of tags you check with your using the first amount of that number to do the problem with. 

## The solution is in tha binary list where each number repersents an iteam in order and wether its included in the best soulution or not. 
   It also inclueds the best love value and the total weight of all the iteams. ##
